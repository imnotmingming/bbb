                awareness of street art. Banksy&#39;s works address various
                political, social, and artistic issues, delivering unique
                perspectives and messages.<br />He never reveals his face and
                creates art in secret, disappearing before anyone notices. Only
                a select few have ever met him, primarily through interviews.
                His artworks are officially recognized as his only when they are
                unveiled on his website.
